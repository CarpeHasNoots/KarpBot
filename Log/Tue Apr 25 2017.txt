Cache or c# is bad, iOS sucks: The opposite behavior of 98% of the population below age 21.Sophistication is a mix of knowing when a joke's over, caring somewhat about the consequences of your actions, talking about something of reasonable importance, having a good dose of common sense, not letting your immediate reactions control your life, knowing how much information is TOO much information, and not wearing wearing your jeans lower than your underwear.

Every girl secretly wishes that he could be her boyfriend...mainly because he recently broke up with his girlfriend...mainly because everyone knows that he likes commitment...mainly because he is sweet and knows how to treat a girl...mainly because however strange and wierd he may be, he's perfect.

I am trained in gorilla warfare and I‚Äôm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You‚Äôre fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that‚Äôs just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little ‚Äúclever‚Äù comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn‚Äôt, you didn‚Äôt, and now you‚Äôre paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You‚Äôre fucking dead, kiddo.

Idolizer or QueenBeyüëë: I don't even understand 2g anymore
Idolizer or QueenBeyüëë: Because you see like admins making sex jokes and shit
Idolizer or QueenBeyüëë: And everyone else
Idolizer or QueenBeyüëë: And then I do it in front of bon
Emolga or null: BANNED
Emolga or null: KICKED
nix or Alex: i think the idea is that
Emolga or null: WARNED
Idolizer or QueenBeyüëë: "THATS VIOLENT GRAPHICAL SEXUAL CONTENT"
nix or Alex: you can make sex jokes to an extent
nix or Alex: there's a red line somewhere
nix or Alex: you get the idea
Idolizer or QueenBeyüëë: "he died on my stick"
Idolizer or QueenBeyüëë: Really
nix or Alex: o
nix or Alex: well i don't know what to tell you
Idolizer or QueenBeyüëë: Like are you kidding me
nix or Alex: some jokes
nix or Alex: good
nix or Alex: some jokes
nix or Alex: bad
nix or Alex: ?
Idolizer or QueenBeyüëë: "he died on my stick"
Idolizer or QueenBeyüëë: Literally what
nix or Alex: who said that?
Idolizer or QueenBeyüëë: "HEY YOU THATS PORN"
Idolizer or QueenBeyüëë: I did and got kicked
Idolizer or QueenBeyüëë: Because apparently that's porn
nix or Alex: it could be an innuendo for rape?
nix or Alex: but no yea it's a bit of a vague rule
Idolizer or QueenBeyüëë: We were talking about Jesus
nix or Alex: @Anti CyberBully WIZARD101!!!!
nix or Alex: jesus
nix or Alex: do you know what moderator got you off the discord?
Idolizer or QueenBeyüëë: Well fuck if that's a rape joke, what's this
Idolizer or QueenBeyüëë: @Alex http://i.imgur.com/X4CMmVl.png
Idolizer or QueenBeyüëë: Can we please like
Idolizer or QueenBeyüëë: Revise 2g
Idolizer or QueenBeyüëë: Holy shit
nix or Alex: no i'm right there with you, favoritism is just making the decisions at this point
nix or Alex: you either consider all sexual-related words as porn 2g or not
ojee or null: asda
Idolizer or QueenBeyüëë: But like 2g is confusing because you could interpret it as saying to never talk about sex or even say "penis" as a joke and we know moderators and admins would be breaking that all the time if that were the intention
Idolizer or QueenBeyüëë: Because like
Idolizer or QueenBeyüëë: It says risqu√© content shall not be tolerated, right?
Idolizer or QueenBeyüëë: ris¬∑qu√©

riÀàskƒÅ/

adjective

slightly indecent or liable to shock, especially by being sexually suggestive.

"his risqu√© humor"
big daddy gunrox or not born in texas: erect genitalia
big daddy gunrox or not born in texas: banned

big daddy gunrox or not born in texas: althought  @QueenBeyüëë you posted some dirty shit before
Idolizer or QueenBeyüëë: @ScriptingRev Yeah what the fuck
nix or Alex: well
Idolizer or QueenBeyüëë: @not born in texas yeah yeah and I was rightfully so banned for that for a month yadda yadda
ScriptingRevolution or ScriptingRev: everyone has a penis or vagina so ...
Idolizer or QueenBeyüëë: But if I say "he died on my stick"
big daddy gunrox or not born in texas: but no one has an asshole ok
Idolizer or QueenBeyüëë: I don't see how that's "EXTREME GRAPHIC PORN"
nix or Alex: put yourself with your family members (eg; sisters, brother, mothers, fathers) and watch a movie depicting sexual scenes
nix or Alex: you'll feel tingly
Atlantis or null: hi
nix or Alex: there's two things i cant allow
Idolizer or QueenBeyüëë: One of my suggestions to a rule change may be a little unpopular
nix or Alex: dimension interviewing me
nix or Alex: and atlantis being in this chat
Atlantis or null: Why's that?
Atlantis or null: @Alex
Idolizer or QueenBeyüëë: But I want to ban sexism (that'd probs be unpopular) and I want to have 2g revised so it's more clear (that'd probably get more popularity)
nix or Alex: @QueenBeyüëë i'm sure if you explain your point of view they'll listen
Idolizer or QueenBeyüëë: Who'll listen lol
nix or Alex: oh i thought you were specifically talking about 2g
nix or Alex: it starts from the top
nix or Alex: you have normal members
nix or Alex: then mods
nix or Alex: notify their admins
Atlantis or null: Scream "Mike Hawk" Out loud very loudly
nix or Alex: or some other related procedure
Idolizer or QueenBeyüëë: Idk I'm scared though cuz I don't even fucking know what's okay anymore
big daddy gunrox or not born in texas: what?
nix or Alex: it's not like your in the wrong
Idolizer or QueenBeyüëë: Because you see fucking Kevin say "muh durpflip is about to engage in hand to gland action" talking about horse dick
Idolizer or QueenBeyüëë: And then like
nix or Alex: you're*
Idolizer or QueenBeyüëë: I say "he died on my stick"
Atlantis or null: you're?
big daddy gunrox or not born in texas: kevins an admin he can do whatever he wants
Idolizer or QueenBeyüëë: BANNED
Atlantis or null: I was born in Texas
Atlantis or null: And live in Texas
Atlantis or null: Houston, Texas
Idolizer or QueenBeyüëë: Who corrected me with you're?
nix or Alex: kevins an exclusion, though i'm sure we can't outrule the fact that many other people are excluded from 2g
Idolizer or QueenBeyüëë: I mean why
Idolizer or QueenBeyüëë: Wait why was I corrected for that I rarely make that mistake
Idolizer or QueenBeyüëë: With your vs you're

Carpe Has Noots or Karp: ;hello
Carpe Has Noots or Karp: ```Hello! As you can see I'm a robot living inside Karp. Only Karp can use me so don't try.```
Carpe Has Noots or Karp: ;bon
nix or Alex: maybe the rule description is too vague? maybe i'm not seeing where the red line is between sex talk and sex talk?
Idolizer or QueenBeyüëë: @Alex okay then here's a better example. Durpflip was talking about horse dick in front of Kevin and Kevin just joked with him
Idolizer or QueenBeyüëë: That's what I mean
Carpe Has Noots or Karp: "theres a difference between making a joke
here and there
and turning the entire chat into a sex chat because you're a retard who cant stop being sexual about everything"
big daddy gunrox or not born in texas: is that a bon quote
nix or Alex: whatever person that had the idea to bring us horse dick is no different than the person who said "jesus died on a stick"
nix or Alex: or whatever
Carpe Has Noots or Karp: @not born in texas Idk is it
Idolizer or QueenBeyüëë: Like 80% of the shit I say is either music video related, political fight related, etc
big daddy gunrox or not born in texas: i have an actual bon quote
Idolizer or QueenBeyüëë: Or me just saying "IM BOREDDDDD"
big daddy gunrox or not born in texas: from dms
big daddy gunrox or not born in texas: "people using selfbots are annoying"
nix or Alex: @Karp bon knows what he's talking about
nix or Alex: take the hint
